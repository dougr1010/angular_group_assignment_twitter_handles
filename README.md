# angular_group_assignment_twitter_handles

This program is an exercise with Angular and file reading.
Files of nouns and verbs are read and combined in random ways, combined with a web URL, then displayed to the page using angular.  The result is a list of possible twitter handles, some that exist, and some that don't.  They can all be called from the page.
